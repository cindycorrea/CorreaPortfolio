        <p>"Satan is no longer even trying to hide his attacks on God’s plan. Emboldened even abounds. Therefore the
            only way to survive spiritually is to be determined to let God prevail in our lived, to learn to hear His
            voice, and to use our energy to help gather Israel."</p>

        <p>“Everything good in life—every potential blessing of eternal significance—begins with faith. Allowing God to
            prevail in our lives begins with faith that He is willing to guide us. True repentance begins with faith
            that Jesus Christ has the power to cleanse, heal, and strengthen us.”</p>

        <p>"Divine love should give us abundant comfort and confidence as we pray to the Father in the name of Christ.
            Not one of us is a stranger to Them. We need not hesitate to call upon God, even when we feel unworthy. We
            can rely on the mercy and merits of Jesus Christ to be heard. As we abide in God’s love, we depend less and
            less on the approval of others to guide us."</p>
