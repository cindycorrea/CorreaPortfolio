    <h1>ADDICTIONS</h1>
    <section class="position">I have found the topic of addictions to be one of the most interesting that I studied. I
        have never struggled with an alcohol or drug addiction, so my initial thought was that this topic doesn’t apply
        to me much, but there are so many other types of addictions and poor habits that we just can’t seem to let go
        of. Here are a few I came up with while studying: playing the victim, over indulging in food, ungratefulness,
        choosing to be miserable, anger, lack of humility, and bringing attention to ourselves. I feel that a few of
        these apply to me. An addiction is not just substance abuse, it is giving into the natural man in ways that harm
        me and others. I need to identify these behaviors and use the power of the Atonement to rid them from my life.

        <p>"The Lord has revealed His sacred standard to guide people in a troubled world. You and I were born free to
            follow His divine guidance. We may choose for ourselves. Those choices may bring addiction or freedom. For
            freedom and joy, choose to ‘be faithful in Christ.’ He will lift you up."</p>
