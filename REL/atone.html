        <p>“Know the doctrine of Christ so that you understand its power for your life. Internalize the truth that the
            Atonement of Jesus Christ applies to you. He took upon Himself your misery, your mistakes, your weakness,
            and
            your sins. He paid the compensatory price and provided the power for you to move every mountain you will
            ever
            face. You obtain that power with your faith, trust, and willingness to follow Him.”</p><a target="_blank" ,

        <p>"His commandments are not grievous—just the opposite. They mark the path of healing, happiness, peace, and
            joy. Our Father and our Redeemer have blessed us with commandments, and in obeying Their commandments, we
            feel Their perfect love more fully and more profoundly."</p>

        <p>"I weep for joy when I contemplate the significance of it all. To be redeemed is to be atoned—received in the
            close embrace of God with an expression not only of His forgiveness, but of our oneness of heart and mind.
            What a privilege!"</p>
