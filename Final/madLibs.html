    <p>This is a story about <span>cindy</span>. She is a <span>silly</span> little girl who thinks she can
        <span>write</span> stories that will make people <span>giggle</span>. She told her <span>teacher</span> about what she was
        planning on doing. He said, "<span>Let's go brandon!</span>" In the end he let her write stories.

        <span>sixteen</span> months later she had a <span>horrible</span> story about a <span>cat
        </span> that fell in love with a <span>couch</span>. <span>35</span> people bought it.
        It is now the most <span>stinky</span> story of all time!</p>
