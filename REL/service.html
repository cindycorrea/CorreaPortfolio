        <p>“Those who are caught up in trying to save their lives by seeking the praise of the world are actually
            rejecting the Savior’s teaching that the only way to save our eternal life is to love one another and lose
            our lives in service.”

        <p>"President Hinckley’s beloved wife, Marjorie Pay Hinckley, put it so well when she said: “We are all in this
            together. We need each other. Oh, how we need each other. Those of us who are old need you who are young.
            And, hopefully, you who are young need some of us who are old. It is a sociological fact that women need
            women. We need deep and satisfying and loyal friendships with each other. These friendships are a necessary
            source of sustenance. We need to renew our faith every day. We need to lock arms and help build the kingdom
            so that it will roll forth and fill the whole earth."</p>

        <p>"Your grandparents had been married for sixty-four years. When someone asked how he was doing, my father
            simply stated, “I’m lonely, but I’m not lonesome.” Do you know what he meant? Though he was now without his
            sweetheart, he was so busy assisting family and friends, he had replaced sorrow with service and had
            displaced self-pity with selfless love. He had found joy in following the timeless example of the Master."
