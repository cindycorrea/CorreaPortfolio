    <h1>GRATITUDE</h1>
    <h2>My Position</h2>
    <section class="position">Gratitude can be used to fight so many wars within ourselves. After reading and listening
        to many inspired talks on this topic, I now see how powerful gratitude can be when practiced righteously. It can
        makes us more humble, more kind, less negative, more generous, more aware, and most importantly, more like our
        Savior. I love President Nelson’s declaration, “Our degree of gratitude is a measure of our love for Him.” This
        really brings gratitude together into one sentence for me. If we love God, we should show gratitude for all that
        he has given us. Not just the big things, but all of the every day little things that happen too. Each and
        everyday we should be giving thanks for something, because every day we have something to be thankful for.

        <p>"Gratitude is a state of appreciation, an act of thanksgiving, which causes us to be humble because we
            recognize an act of kindness, service, or caring from someone else which lifts us and strengthens us."</p>

        <p>"Gratitude on a daily basis means we express appreciation for what we have now without qualification for what
            we had in the past or desire in the future. A recognition of and appreciation for our gifts and talents
            which have been given also allows us to acknowledge the need for help and assistance from the gifts and
            talents possessed by others."</p>

        <p>"We can choose to be grateful, no matter what. This type of gratitude transcends whatever is happening around
            us. It surpasses disappointment,
            discouragement, and despair. It blooms just as beautifully in the icy landscape of winter as it does in the
            pleasant warmth of summer."</p>

        <p>"When we give thanks in all things, we see hardships and adversities in the context of the purpose of life.
            We are sent here to be tested. There must be opposition in all things. We are meant to learn and grow
