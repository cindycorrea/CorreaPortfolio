        <p>"With the Lord, families are essential. He created the earth that we could gain physical bodies and form
            families. He established His Church to exalt families. He provides temples so that families can be together
            forever."</p>

        <p>"If you are the one afflicted or a caregiver to such [with depression], try not to be overwhelmed with the
            size of your task. Don’t assume you can fix everything, but fix what you can. If those are only small
            victories, be grateful for them and be patient. Dozens of times in the scriptures, the Lord commands someone
            to “stand still” or 'be still'—and wait. Patiently enduring some things is part of our mortal education."
