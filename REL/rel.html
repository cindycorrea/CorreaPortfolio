    <h1>Capstone Project</h1>
    <h2 class="name fix-it">Cindy Correa</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the accumulation of my Capstone Project for Teachings of Living Prophets. This project was designed to
        "help [me] live faithfully as I walk [my] path in these complex and difficult times." (Project Instructions)
        This project is broken up
        into three sections: Learn, Listen, Walk.</p>
    <h3>Learn</h3>
    <p>The first section of the project focused on the topics I was going to study. I was assigned the following four
        topics: Family,
        Atonement, Agency, and Addictions. I was given the task of choosing four more topics based on what I felt I
        needed most in my life. The topics I chose were: Gratitude, Joy in Motherhood, Service, and Let God Prevail.</p>
    <h3>Listen</h3>
    <p>I had the pleasure of
        researching ten quotes for each of my eight topics. These quotes can be accessed through the menu navigation by
        topic. After each quote, you will find a convenient link to each of
        the talks where I
        found my quotes. This was my favorite part of the project. I loved going back and listening to the apostles and
        prophets lead and guide us through the years.</p>
    <h3>Walk</h3>
    <p>In the last section of the project, I was to choose one of my topics to apply to my life. I developed a plan to
        implement it and faithfully executed it. The rest of this page is the report from this phase of
        the project. </p>
    <h3 class="name">Let God Prevail</h3>
    <p>Over the course of the last six weeks I have strived to let God have a greater impact on my life. </p>
