            voice, and to use our energy to help gather Israel."</p>

        <p>“Everything good in life—every potential blessing of eternal significance—begins with faith. Allowing God to
            prevail in our lives begins with faith that He is willing to guide us. True repentance begins with faith
            that Jesus Christ has the power to cleanse, heal, and strengthen us.”</p>
