        <p>"Gratitude is a state of appreciation, an act of thanksgiving, which causes us to be humble because we
            recognize an act of kindness, service, or caring from someone else which lifts us and strengthens us."</p>

        <p>"Gratitude on a daily basis means we express appreciation for what we have now without qualification for what
            we had in the past or desire in the future. A recognition of and appreciation for our gifts and talents
            which have been given also allows us to acknowledge the need for help and assistance from the gifts and
            talents possessed by others."</p>

        <p>"We can choose to be grateful, no matter what. This type of gratitude transcends whatever is happening around
            us. It surpasses disappointment,
            discouragement, and despair. It blooms just as beautifully in the icy landscape of winter as it does in the
            pleasant warmth of summer."</p>

        <p>"I have learned that there is something that would take away the bitterness that may come into our lives.
            There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter, more joyful, even glorious. We can be grateful!"</p>
