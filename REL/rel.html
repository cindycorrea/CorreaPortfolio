    <h1>Capstone Project</h1>
    <h2 class="name fix-it">Cindy Correa</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the accumulation of my Capstone Project for Teachings of Living Prophets. This project was designed to
        "help [me] live faithfully as I walk [my] path in these complex and difficult times." (Project Instructions)
        This project is broken up
        into three sections: Learn, Listen, Walk.</p>
    <h2>Learn</h2>
    <p>The first section of the project focused on the topics I was going to study. I was assigned the following four
        topics: Family,
        Atonement, Agency, and Addictions. I was given the task of choosing four more topics based on what I felt I
        needed most in my life. The topics I chose were: Gratitude, Joy in Motherhood, Service, and Let God Prevail.</p>
    <h2>Listen</h2>
    <p>I had the pleasure of
        researching ten quotes for each of my eight topics. These quotes can be accessed through the menu navigation by
        topic. Before the quotes, you will find my position statement on the topic. I prayerfully considered each topic
        and wrote my feelings and what I learned. After each quote, you will find a convenient link to each of
        the talks where I
        found my quotes. This was my favorite part of the project. I loved going back and listening to the apostles and
        prophets lead and guide us through the years.</p>
    <h2>Walk</h2>
    <p>In the last section of the project, I was to choose one of my topics to apply to my life. I developed a plan to
        implement it and faithfully executed it. The rest of this page is the report from this phase of
        the project. </p>
    <h3 class="name">Let God Prevail</h3>
    <p>Over the course of the last six weeks I have strived to let God have a greater impact on my life. I accomplished
        this through greater effort to have daily, personal prayers, attending the temple on a bi-weekly basis, focusing
        my thoughts and actions on the Savior, and keeping a journal each week of my experiences.</p><br>

    <p>I was not completely perfect with daily prayer. I kept a record of when I was successful by my bed. Some nights
        I felt like I was just doing it to get my checkmark. Most of the time, though, I was doing it because I knew
        that my relationship with my Father in Heaven would be strengthened because of my faithfulness.</p><br>

    <p>I was able to attend the temple every other week. This is a goal that I will continue to maintain. I struggled
        with this in the beginning because of the mask mandate. By the second time I went, the mandate had been lifted!
        This felt like a personal answer to my prayers. In my temple attendance I also gained a greater appreciation for
        the covenants I have made with God. I feel like my understanding has increased and I value my time there even
        more now.</p><br>

    <p>Keeping my thoughts focused on a more Christ-centered life was the most difficult for sure. There are a lot of
        things that frustrate me in today’s world. It was incredible to me how my thought process changed over these
        last six weeks. I have felt myself relax and understand this scripture better, “Peace I leave with you, my peace
        I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
        afraid.” (John 14:27) This scripture has been the catalyst for my change. I truly have been able to maintain a
        better hold on life through understanding that God is present in this world and he can help me in my individual
        life. I NEED Him. I will continue to remember to let God prevail.</p><br>

    <h2>Excerpts from my weekly journal entries</h2>
    <div class="journal">
        <h4>February 20-26</h4>
        <p>I think that my plan is solid and it will help me stay more humble throughout the week and keep God in my
            life
            better. I’m looking forward to the blessings and insight this project will give me.</p>

        <h4>February 27- March 5</h4>
        <p>I struggle with the mask mandate. I won’t get into why, I just can’t wear the mask. The temples are currently
            still requiring them to attend the temple. Today was my temple day. I had my appointment set up, but all
            night I was stressing out about going. In the morning, I was talking to my best friend about it and she
            said,
            “Why not call and ask if you can not wear it? At least you won’t drive all the way out there just to come
            home because you have to wear it.” I brushed off her suggestion initially, but then decided to try calling a
            while later. The woman on the phone told me she would see if someone would call me back about it. Thirty
            minutes later the temple president called me. He said that if I could wear it coming in past the
            recommend desk then I could take it off everywhere else.
            That was such a relief! It was an answer to my morning prayer. I went to the temple and did just that. After
            I got home the temple president called me again and thanked me for coming to the temple and told me he hoped
            I would come back again. He said, “We want you in the temple. You are always welcome.” I feel like because I
            tried to handle it
            in a way that let God’s will prevail in my life I received a tender mercy today. The Lord knows where I am
            and my desire to be in the temple and today He made it possible.</p>

        <h4>March 6-12</h4>
        <p>I really focused on showing Christ-like love to others this week. I had an interaction with my sister that
            went nicely when I tried to listen to the spirit and let God’s example prevail in my life. She was dealing
            with a difficult situation and needed advice. I believe
            that the advice I gave her was solid and because I put God first, I was able to help her put God first and
            understand certain aspects of the situation that she might not have seen otherwise. I thanked Heavenly
            Father for the help with this situation. </p>

    <div class="journal">
        <h4>March 13-19</h4>
        <p>This week I attended the temple. For this first time in two years, masks were not required at our temple. I
            know that this was a decision that was made prayerfully and one that effected hundreds of temples, but this
            week it felt like a personal answer to prayer. The relief I felt, and the relief in others, was palatable.
            Everyone was smiling and extra welcoming. I knew I was where I was suppose to be, I knew that God wanted me
            to be there.</p><br>
        <p>I’ve been much better about saying my personal prayers. Although I feel like I don’t have the right mindset
            with it. I’m saying my prayers more to make sure I check off a box on a goal sheet than to have a greater
            relationship with my Father in Heaven. I want to change my mindset on this part of my plan. I think I will
            look to some conference talks for better guidance on this. </p>

        <h4>March 20-26</h4>
        <p>I have really worked hard to pray for opportunities to serve others this week. This last Sunday I had a
            chance to do so in a very unexpected way. Our lesson in Relief Society on Sunday was on Elder Soares’ talk
            “The Savior’s Abiding Compassion”. We spent most of the time talking about experiences other sister have had
            with people showing them compassion. We also talked about how Christ taught that social norms and culture
            should have no bearing on compassion. Before the lesson started I invited an older women to sit with me when
            she entered the room. I chatted with her a little bit and noticed that something was “off”. Before the
            lesson started she was asked to give the closing prayer. At the conclusion of the class she got up to say
            the closing prayer. She started off great, but then started to hesitate. It got very awkward and I believe
            everyone started to feel really bad for her. Despite feeling a little nervous and knowing that I was
            completely breaking social norms by doing what I was about to do, I stood up in the middle of the prayer,
            walked up to this older sister, put my arm around her and finished the prayer for her. When I was finished,
            she looked over at me with tears in her eyes and said, “Thank you”. I felt grateful that the Lord had given
            me an opportunity to serve this sister in an unexpected way. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="journal">
        <h4>March 27- April 2</h4>
        <p>I’ve felt a bit overwhelmed this week with everything I’ve needed to accomplish to finish my classes for this
            semester. So when my temple appointment day came up I almost canceled my appointment so I could work more on
            my schoolwork at home. Instead I rescheduled my appointment so I was doing Initiatory instead of Endowment.
            The funny thing is, I ended up staying in the temple just as long because I just wanted to be in the temple.
        </p><br>
        <p>I had a conversation with one of the temple workers about how many times a deceased sister’s name is said in
            the temple when their time comes to go through. We estimated about twenty times between all of the
            ordinances, more if they have children to be sealed to them. The names of the sisters I performed Initiatory
            for were each said eight times. I’ve never thought about it like this before. Their names are literally being
            called from the earth. </p>
