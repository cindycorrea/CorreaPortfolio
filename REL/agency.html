        <p>“These truths I know: God, our Heavenly Father, wants you to choose to come home to Him. His plan of eternal
            progression is not complicated, and it honors your agency. You are free to choose who you will be - and with
            whom you will be - in the world to come!”

        <p>"As you continue to face many challenging choices in life, remember, there is great protection when you know
            who you are, why you are here, and where you are going. Let your unique identity shape each decision you
            make on the path toward your eternal destiny. Accountability for your choices now will bear on all that lies
            ahead."</p>

        <p>"I think we would all agree that those who profess no religious belief can be, and often are, good, moral
            people. We would not agree, however, that this happens without divine influence. I am referring to the Light
            of Christ. The Savior declared, ‘I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.’
            Whether aware of it or not, every man, woman, and child of every belief, place, and time is imbued with the
            Light of Christ and therefore possesses the sense of right and wrong we often call conscience."</p>

        <p>"Agency was a principal issue in the premortal Council in Heaven and the conflict between those who chose to
            follow Christ and the followers of Satan. Letting go of pride and control and choosing the Savior would
            allow us to have His light and His peace."</p>
