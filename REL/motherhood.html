        <p>“May I say to mothers collectively, in the name of the Lord, you are magnificent. You are doing terrifically
            well. The very fact that you have been given such a responsibility is everlasting evidence of the trust your
            Father in Heaven has in you.”</p>

        <p>“Mothers and daughters play a critical role in helping each other explore their infinite possibilities,

        <p>"Young women, your mothers adore you. They see in you the promise of future generations. Everything you
            accomplish, every challenge you overcome brings them pure joy. And likewise your worries and heartaches are

        <p>"A wonderful young mother recently wrote to me: ‘…How can mortal love be so strong that you voluntarily
            subject yourself to responsibility, vulnerability, anxiety, and heartache and just keep coming back for more
            of the same? What kind of mortal love can make you feel, once you have a child, that your life is never,
            ever your own again? Maternal love has to be divine.’"</p>

        <p>"I hope that you mothers will realize that when all is said and done, you have no more compelling
            responsibility, nor any laden with greater rewards, than the nurture you give your children in an
            environment of security, peace, companionship, love, and motivation to grow and do well."</p>

        <p>"Satan has declared war on motherhood. He knows that those who rock the cradle can rock his earthly empire.
