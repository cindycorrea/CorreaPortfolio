        <p>“Know the doctrine of Christ so that you understand its power for your life. Internalize the truth that the
            Atonement of Jesus Christ applies to you. He took upon Himself your misery, your mistakes, your weakness,
            and
            your sins. He paid the compensatory price and provided the power for you to move every mountain you will
            ever
            face. You obtain that power with your faith, trust, and willingness to follow Him.”</p><a target="_blank" ,

            What a privilege!"</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>"For His Atonement to be infinite and eternal, He had to feel what it was like to die not only physically but
            spiritually, to sense what it was like to have the divine Spirit withdraw, leaving one feeling totally,
            abjectly, hopelessly alone.

            But Jesus held on. He pressed on. The goodness in Him allowed faith to triumph even in a state of complete
            anguish. The trust He lived by told Him in spite of His feelings that divine compassion is never absent,
            that God is always faithful, that He never flees nor fails us."</p>

        <p>"Because Jesus walked such a long, lonely path utterly alone, we do not have to do so. His solitary journey
            brought great company for our little version of that path—the merciful care of our Father in Heaven, the
            unfailing companionship of this Beloved Son, the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost, angels in heaven, family
            members on both sides of the veil, prophets and apostles, teachers, leaders, friends. All of these and more
            have been given as companions for our mortal journey because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the
            Restoration of His gospel."</p>

        <p>"In spite of betrayal and pain, mistreatment and cruelty, and bearing all the accumulated sins and sorrows of
            the human family, the Son of the living God looked down the long path of mortality, saw us this weekend, and
            said: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not
            your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."</p>

        <p>"His divine birth, His perfect life, His infinite Atonement at Gethsemane and Golgotha assured the
            Resurrection of each of us. And with our sincere repentance, He alone is able to cleanse us from our sins,
            allowing us to return to the presence of God. ‘We love him, because he first loved us.’"</p>
